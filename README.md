# Enver Kollari | AI-Native Product Engineer & Founder
### "Engineering Scalable Products with Senior Business Logic, Delivered at AI-Native Speed."

I am a Product Engineer with **13+ years of seniority in Banking and Business Operations**. I bridge the gap between complex business requirements and high-performance software. By leveraging **AI-Native workflows**, I deliver production-grade systems with the precision of a senior executive and the velocity of an AI-augmented agent.
